#Notes

- make sure to run npm install
- make sure to run bower install
- You can run this npm start - but make sure to add your API Key to the package.json
- You will need to run sass:watch - this will create and watch scss files
- Run bower install as public/vendor is not part of solution
- Note that there is call for planner.js (this could be the only file you modify)
